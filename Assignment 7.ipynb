    "    * At least one relationship is required to have a participation constraint. The relationship with the participation constraint cannot be a weak entity.\n",
    "    * To keep things interesting (and to get some more practice with relational tables), We warmly recommend having a mix of different relationship types.\n",

    "* At least one meaningful ISA OR weak entity relationship. You can have both an ISA and a weak entity relationship if you wish.\n",

    "* Car rental service (used in CPSC 304)\n",

    "        * If you want to do something in retail, consider other aspects of retail, like maybe inventory tracking, shipping, etc., and don’t focus on ordering.\n",
    "    * Hospital or medical clinic\n",
    "* Any other examples presented in the course including but not limited to schools/courses/departments, movie/moviestars, and a grocery store\n",
